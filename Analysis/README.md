## Research Designs

Each research design aims to help us answer the question about the  effect of
the sale of marijuana at pharmacies on the attitudes and perceptions of the
neighbors.

 1. 20 pharmacies having sold marijuana at some point in the year versus 42
    using census data and endline the comparison.
 2. 16 pharmacies having sold marijuana from the beginning versus 42 using
    both baseline data and census data for the comparison. (No post-treatment
bias because creating the sets using only attributes measured before marijuana
selling began.)
 3. 2 vs 20 (Placebo versus Active) (Census and Endline Data Comparison for
    Design.) ( expect effect if the effect is about selling)
 4. 2 vs 42 (Placebo versus Control) (expect no effect if the effect is about
    selling)
 5. 10 (whole time) versus 10 (part of the time --- either stopped or started).
    (expect larger effects on the 10 selling the whole time)
